As Long As You Love Me
long as you love me yeah
I'm under pressure, seven billion people in the world trying to fit in
Keep it together, smile on your face even though your heart is frowning
But hey now, you know girl, we both know it's a cruel world
But I will take my chances
As long as you love me, we could be starving,
We could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, i'll be your gold
As long as you lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love me
As long as you lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love me love me
I'll be your soldier, fighting every second of the day for the dreams girl
I'll be your Hova, you can be my Destiny's Child on a scene girl
Don't stress, don't cry, oh we don't need no wings to fly
Just take my hand
As you love me we could be starving,
We could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, i'll be your gold
哈哈哈
